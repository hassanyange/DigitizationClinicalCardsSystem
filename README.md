# Clinical Card  Digitalization Project

## Introduction

Maternal mortality is a pressing issue in Tanzania, and this project aims to address it by digitalizing clinical systems through Electronic Health Records (EHR). This README provides an overview of the project's importance, challenges addressed, and objectives.

## Problem Statement

The manual entry of medical information using paper clinical cards poses numerous challenges such as limited accessibility, interoperability issues, security concerns, and data loss risks. Digitizing clinical cards through a web application addresses these challenges by providing accessible, secure, and easily manageable electronic health records.

## Objectives

**Main Objective:** Transforming from traditional paper-based clinical systems to electronic health records using information and communication technology.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Establish requirements for transitioning to electronic health records.
2. Design a clinical web application system based on established requirements.
3. Develop the system according to the design.
4. Evaluate the usability of the clinical system in clinical centers.
